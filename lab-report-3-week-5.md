## grep 

**grep -win**

![flightToBoston](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68180000/199080874-a216610c-3b8a-4675-b033-809c2dd9dc52.jpg)

This command searches in the specific file outlined for the word (in this case words) given. It then returns the block of lines containing this phrase. The phrase I used as an example was "flight to Boston" in chapter-1.txt of 911reports. 

**grep -n**

![boardingFlights](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68180000/199081829-5fa2c10c-feb2-4770-9950-e7cd443ed62a.jpg)

I used grep -n to find a line that matches the given input (in my case it was "Boarding the Flights"). It also returns the line number, which was 12. 

**grep -o**

![attaAndOmari](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68180000/199082330-2192f1dd-05e8-4955-81d4-2d1f2b1efadd.jpg)

grep -o only prints the parts of the line that match the input. It prints on a new line for each different line in which the input is found. So for example, "Atta and Omari" was the input, and it was found on four different lines, so the phrase printed four times on separate lines. It does not include the line number.
