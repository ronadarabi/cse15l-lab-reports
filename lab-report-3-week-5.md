## find 

**find -empty**

find -empty searches for all the files and directories that are emtpy and returns a list of them. This can be useful for users who needed a quick way to locate empty files and directories. 

**find -iname**

In this example I used two commands, first -type and then -iname. -type f specifies that we are looking for a file. -iname is a more specific form of -name that gives us our exact search. This can be useful if you know the name of a file but want the exact path. 

**find -exec**

First we use find -name to find the specific file. -exec allows you to execute commands on this file. rm will remove the file, but adding -i ensures that the system asks the user before actually doing so. If you enter Y or y, it will delete the file.
