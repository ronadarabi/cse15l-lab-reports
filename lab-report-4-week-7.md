## Week 7 Lab Report

## Part 1

The task I have chosen is: 
* Changing the name of the ```start``` parameter and its uses to ```base```

The shortest sequence that we could come up with is: 

`/`  `s` `t` `a` `r` `t` `<Enter>` `c` `e` `b` `a` `s` `e` `<esc>` `n` `.` `n` `.` `n` `.` `:` `w` `q` `<Enter>`

which has a total of 24 keystrokes. Because of the use of keys such as `n` and `.`, there was no need to move the cursor. Below is a step-by-step version:

`/`  `s` `t` `a` `r` `t`



`<Enter>`



`c` `e`



`b` `a` `s` `e` `<esc>`



`n` `.`



`n` `.`



`n` `.` 



`w` `q` `<Enter>`




## Part 2

The first method took me 01:33.17. The only part that ate up time was ensuring that I made all the changes necessary before copying it over to the remote. The second method took me XX.  

Of the two styles, it seems that `vim` is easiest as I can make a quick change and have it saved on the remote (rather than having to copy it). If the change I have to make requires a lot more work than this task, then I might opt for the first method. If I have to make small, repetitive changes, then `vim` would be a better choice!
